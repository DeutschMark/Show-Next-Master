# Show Next Master

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It displays the next Master in the currently active edit view. This can be usefull in different ways:  

1. Compare the currently active with the next master. No visual overkill of seein all masters or interpolations at once.  
2. Set up your font with additional masters that have the custom name "Original". These can be used as a visual comparisson feedback (e.g. older Versions). The "Original" master will be highlighted in red when active, this is meant as a warning to keep your hands off it.  

### Install

1. Install via the Plugin Manager in Glyphs.
2. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show * Next Master` from the view menu.
