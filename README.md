# Show Next Master

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays the next Master in the currently active edit view. This can be usefull in many ways. For instance if you want to compare the current with the next master but without the visual overkill of seein all masters at once. Another handy feature is to set up your font with additional masters that have the custom name "Original". These can be used as a visual comparisson feedback (e.g. with older Versions). If you do this, the Original master will be highlighted in red, in order inform you that you are in the original master that you might not want to touch.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon). Double click the .reporter file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install. Or copy the `ShowNodeCount.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
