# Show Next Master

### Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays the next Master in the currently active edit view. This can be usefull in different ways:
1. Compare the currently active with the next master. No visual overkill of seein all masters or interpolations at once.
2. Set up your font with additional masters that have the custom name "Original". These can be used as a visual comparisson feedback (e.g. older Versions). The "Original" master will be highlighted in red when active, this is meant as a warning to keep your hands off it.

### Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Either:  
   Double click the `.reporter` file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install.  
   Or:  
   Copy the `.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`)
3. restart Glyphs

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show * Next Master` from the view menu.
